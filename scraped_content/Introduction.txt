The software is used extensively in several domains including hospitals, banks, schools, defense, finance, stock markets, and so on. It can be categorized into different types: 1. Based on Application System Software – This type of software helps manage the hardware of your computer, like an operating system that controls how the computer works. Application Software –  These are the programs we use every day, such as word processors or music players, to perform specific tasks. Web Applications Software – These are programs you access via a web browser, like checking your email or managing your bank account online. Embedded Software- This software is built into devices like cars, home appliances, or factory machinery to help them function properly. Reservation Software : Used to manage bookings and reservations, such as for hotels, flights, or restaurant tables. Business Software- Designed to help businesses run smoothly, this software includes things like CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tools and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems. Artificial Intelligence Software- These programs use machine learning to mimic human intelligence and perform tasks like recommendations or chatbots. Scientific Software- Software used by researchers for tasks like simulations, analyzing data, or modeling experiments. 2. Based on Copyright Commercial Software : This is software you pay for, usually with a license that limits how it can be used, shared, or changed. Shareware Software : This software is available for free for a limited time or with limited features, with the hope that users will eventually pay for the full version. Freeware Software : Software that’s completely free to use, but the source code is usually not available for you to change or share. Public Domain Software : This software is free for everyone to use, modify, and share without any copyright restrictions. For more details please refer to the following article Classifications of Software . 3. Explain SDLC and its Phases? SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle . It is a process followed for software building within a software organization . SDLC consists of a precise plan that describes how to develop, maintain, replace, and enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a method for improving the quality of software and the all-around development process. 6 Stages of Software Development Life Cycle Phases of SDLC : Following are the phases of SDLC: Planning and Requirement Analysis : This is where we figure out the project’s goals, understand what users need, and set clear expectations for what the software should do. Defining Requirements : Here, we get into the specifics—laying out exactly what the software needs to do (functional) and how well it should do it (non-functional). Designing Architecture : At this stage, we build a blueprint for the software, deciding on the overall structure and the technical details to make sure it meets the requirements. Developing Product : This is where the coding happens, turning the design into a working product by writing the actual software. Product Testing and Integration : Now, we test the software for bugs, check that everything works together smoothly, and make sure all the parts are integrated properly. Deployment and Maintenance of Products : Finally, the software is deployed for use, and we continue to monitor and maintain it to fix any issues and keep it running smoothly over time. For more details, please refer to the following article Software Development Life Cycle. 4. What are different SDLC Models Available? Here are the models which is available for the SDLC: Waterfall Model – This is a straightforward, step-by-step process where each phase must be finished before moving on to the next. It’s ideal for projects with clear and fixed requirements from the start. V-Model – Also called the Verification and Validation model, this approach focuses on testing each part of the development process as you go. For every phase of development, there’s a corresponding testing phase. Incremental Model – Instead of developing everything at once, this model breaks the software into smaller, manageable pieces or “increments.” These pieces are developed and delivered one at a time, allowing users to get a working version early on. RAD Model – This model focuses on getting the software up and running quickly through prototypes and constant user feedback. It works well for projects with clear user requirements and tight deadlines. Iterative Model – In this approach, development happens in cycles. After each cycle, a version of the software is tested, feedback is gathered, and improvements are made in the next cycle. Spiral Model – This model combines design and prototyping while focusing heavily on risk assessment. It involves repeating phases of planning, design, development, and testing with each loop, addressing any risks along the way. Prototype model – Here, a working version of the product (prototype) is created early on. This allows users to interact with it and give feedback, which helps shape the final product. Agile Model – Agile is all about flexibility. Development happens in short bursts, or sprints, with constant feedback from the customer. This model allows for changes at any stage, making it adaptable and responsive to evolving needs. For more details, please refer to the following article Top Software Development Models (SDLC) Models . 5. What is the Waterfall Method and What are its Use Cases? The waterfall model is a software development model used in the context of large, complex projects, typically in the field of information technology. It is characterized by a structured, sequential approach to project management and software development. Phases of Waterfall Model: Requirements Gathering and Analysis : This is the first step where you gather all the details about what the client needs and analyze them to understand exactly what the software should do. Design Phase : Once you have a clear idea of the requirements, you move on to designing how the system will work. This is where you figure out the structure and how different parts of the software will fit together. Implementation and Unit Testing : Now it’s time to start coding. In this phase, developers write the actual software and test each small piece (or module) to make sure it works properly on its own. Integration and System Testing : After all the individual modules are built and tested, they’re put together to form the complete system. The whole system is tested to ensure everything works as expected when all the parts are connected. Deployment : Once the software is tested and ready, it’s launched and made available to users in the real world. Maintenance : After the software is up and running, it enters the maintenance phase. This involves fixing any issues users find and making updates as needed to keep everything running smoothly. Use Case of Waterfall Model Requirements are clear and fixed that may not change. There are no ambiguous requirements (no confusion). It is good to use this model when the technology is well understood. The project is short and cast is low. Risk is zero or minimum. Waterfall Model For more details, please refer to the following article Waterfall Model. 6. What is Black Box Testing? The black box test (also known as the conducted test/ closed box test/ opaque box test) is software testing technique. In this technique, tester does not care about the internal knowledge or implementation details but rather focuses on validating the functionality based on the provided specifications or requirements. The name “black box” refers to the idea that the internal workings are hidden from the tester’s view. For more details, please refer to the following article Software Engineering – Black Box Testing. 7.  What is White Box Testing? White Box Testing is a method of analyzing the internal structure, data structures used, internal design, code structure, and behavior of software, as well as functions such as black-box testing. Also called glass-box test or clear box test or structural test. For more details, please refer to the following article Software Engineering – White Box Testing. 8. Distinguish between Alpha and Beta Testing? Following are the differences between Alpha and Beta Testing: Alpha Testing Beta Testing Alpha testing involves both white box and black box testing. Beta testing commonly uses black-box testing. Alpha testing is performed by testers who are usually internal employees of the organization. Beta testing is performed by clients who are not part of the organization. Alpha testing is performed at the developer’s site. Beta testing is performed at the end-user,  the of the product. Reliability and security testing are not checked in alpha testing. Reliability, security, and robustness are checked during beta testing. Alpha testing ensures the quality of the product before forwarding it to beta testing. Beta testing also concentrates on the quality of the product but collects the user’s time-long input on the product and ensures that the product is ready for real-time users. Alpha testing requires a testing environment or a lab. Beta testing doesn’t require a testing environment or lab. Alpha testing may require a real-time long execution cycle. Beta testing requires only a few weeks of execution. Developers can immediately address the critical issues or fixes in alpha testing. Most of the issues or feedback collected from the beta testing will be implemented in future versions of the product For more details, please refer to the following article Alpha Testing and Beta Testing . 9. What is Debugging? Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving errors, or bugs, in a software system. It is an important aspect of software engineering because bugs can cause a software system to malfunction, and can lead to poor performance or incorrect results. Debugging can be a time-consuming and complex task, but it is essential for ensuring that a software system is functioning correctly. For more details, please refer to the following article What is Debugging? 10. What is a Feasibility Study? The Feasibility Study in Software Engineering is a study that analyze whether a proposed software project is practical or not.

Validation is a dynamic mechanism of validation and testing the actual product. It does not involve executing the code. It always involves executing the code. It is human-based checking of documents and files. It is computer-based execution of the program. Verification uses methods like inspections, reviews, walkthroughs, and Desk-checking, etc. Validation uses methods like black box (functional) testing, gray box testing, and white box (structural) testing, etc. Verification is to check whether the software conforms to specifications. Validation is to check whether the software meets the customer’s expectations and requirements. It can catch errors that validation cannot catch. It can catch errors that verification cannot catch. Target is requirements specification, application and software architecture, high level, complete design, and database design, etc. Target is an actual product-a unit, a module, a bent of integrated modules, and an effective final product. Verification is done by QA team to ensure that the software is as per the specifications in the SRS document. Validation is carried out with the involvement of the testing team It generally comes first done before validation. It generally follows after verification. It is low-level exercise. It is a High-Level Exercise. For more details, please refer to the following article Software Engineering – Verification and Validation. 13. What is a Baseline?

For more details, please refer to the following article baseline . Software Engineering Interview Questions for Intermediate Here are the Top Software Engineering Interview Questions for Intermediate: 14. What is Cohesion and Coupling? Cohesion indicates the relative functional capacity of the module. Aggregation modules need to interact less with other sections of other parts of the program to perform a single task. It can be said that only one coagulation module (ideally) needs to be run. Cohesion is a measurement of the functional strength of a module. A module with high cohesion and low coupling is functionally independent of other modules. Here, functional independence means that a cohesive module performs a single operation or function. The coupling means the overall association between the modules. Coupling relies on the information delivered through the interface with the complexity of the interface between the modules in which the reference to the section or module was created. High coupling support Low coupling modules assume that there are virtually no other modules. It is exceptionally relevant when both modules exchange a lot of information. The level of coupling between two modules depends on the complexity of the interface. For more details, please refer to the following article Coupling and cohesion. 15. What is the Agile software development model?

Which SDLC Model is the Best? The selection of the best SDLC model is a strategic decision that requires a thorough understanding of the project’s requirements, constraints, and goals. While each model has its strengths and weaknesses, the key is to align the chosen model with the specific characteristics of the project. Being flexible, adaptable, and communicating well are crucial in dealing with the complexities of making software and making sure the final product is good. In the end, the best way to develop software is the one that suits the project’s needs and situation the most. For more details, please refer to the following article Which SDLC Model is Best and Why ? 37. What is the Black Hole Concept in DFD? A block hole concept in the data flow diagram can be defined as “A processing step may have input flows but no output flows”. In a black hole, data can only store inbound flows. 38. Which of the Testing is Used for Fault Simulation? With increased expectations for software component quality and the complexity of components, software developers are expected to perform effective testing. In today’s scenario, mutation testing has been used as a fault injection technique to measure test adequacy. Mutation Testing adopts “fault simulation mode”. 39. Which Model is Used to Check Software Reliability? A Rayleigh model is used to check software reliability. The Rayleigh model is a parametric model in the sense that it is based on a specific statistical distribution. When the parameters of the statistical distribution are estimated based on the data from a software project, projections about the defect rate of the project can be made based on the model. 40. What is the Difference between Risk and Uncertainty? Risk is able to be measured while uncertainty is not able to be measured. Risk can be calculated while uncertainty can never be counted. You are capable of make earlier plans in order to avoid risk. It is impossible to make prior plans for the uncertainty. Certain sorts of empirical observations can help to understand the risk but on the other hand, the uncertainty can never be based on empirical observations. After making efforts, the risk is able to be converted into certainty. On the contrary, you can’t convert uncertainty into certainty. After making an estimate of the risk factor, a decision can be made but as the calculation of the uncertainty is not possible, hence no decision can be made. 41. What is CMM? To determine an organization’s current state of process maturity, the SEI uses an assessment that results in a five-point grading scheme. The grading scheme determines compliance with a capability maturity model (CMM) that deﬁnes key activities required at different levels of process maturity. The SEI approach provides a measure of the global effectiveness of a company’s software engineering practices and establishes ﬁve process maturity levels that are deﬁned in the following manner: Level 1: Initial Level 2: Repeatable Level 3: Defined Level 4: Managed Level 5: Optimizing For more details, please refer to the following article CMM . 43. A software does not wear out in the traditional sense of the term, but the software does tend to deteriorate as it evolves, why? The software does not wear out in the traditional sense of the term, but the software does tend to deteriorate as it evolves because  Multiple change requests introduce errors in component interactions. Unlike hardware, software doesn’t physically wear out. However, it tends to deteriorate as it evolves because every time new features or updates are added, there’s a chance of introducing new bugs or compatibility issues. Over time, multiple changes can cause different parts of the software to interact in unexpected ways, making it harder to maintain. If these issues aren’t managed properly, the software becomes more complex and prone to failure, which affects its performance and reliability. 44.  What are the elements to be considered in the System Model Construction? The type and size of the software, the experience of use for reference to predecessors, difficulty level to obtain users’ needs, development techniques and tools, the situation of the development team, development risks, the software development methods should be kept in mind. It is an important prerequisite to ensure the success of software development that designing a reasonable and suitable software development plan. 45. Define Adaptive Maintenance? Adaptive maintenance defines as modifications and updating when the customers need the product to run on new platforms, on new operating systems, or when they need the product to interface with new hardware and software. 46. Define the term WBS? The full form of WBS is Work Breakdown Structure. Its Work Breakdown Structure includes dividing a large and complex project into simpler, manageable, and independent tasks. For constructing a work breakdown structure, each node is recursively decomposed into smaller sub-activities, until at the leaf level, the activities become undividable and independent. A WBS works on a top-down approach. For more detail please refer Work breakdown structure article. 47. How to Find the Size of a Software Product? Estimation of the size of the software is an essential part of Software Project Management. It helps the project manager to further predict the effort and time which will be needed to build the project. Various measures are used in project size estimation. Some of these are: Lines of Code Number of entities in ER diagram Total number of processes in detailed data flow diagram Function points 48. What is Concurrency, and How to Achieve it ? Concurrency refers to a system’s ability to execute numerous tasks or processes at the same time, ostensibly concurrently. It is a wider concept that includes the idea of completing many jobs in concurrent intervals. In a concurrent system, tasks can begin, run, and finish in overlapping time frames, increasing overall system efficiency and responsiveness. There are many programming language available that support concurrency using unthreading example Java, C++ etc. 49. Why is Modularization important in Software Engineering? Modular programming makes your code easier to read by dividing it into functions that only deal with one part of the overall functionality. When compared to monolithic code, it can make your files significantly smaller and easier to read. 50. Which Process Model Removes Defects before Software get into trouble? Clean room software engineering is a software development approach to producing quality software. In clean room software engineering, an efficient and good quality software product is delivered to the client as QA (Quality Assurance) is performed each and every phase of software development. 51. Difference between an EXE and DLL? DLL refers to Dynamic Link Library, and EXE is an executable. An EXE assembly can execute in its own address space, whereas a DLL cannot. It does not have its own address space, therefore it must run within a host and requires a consumer to invoke it.
