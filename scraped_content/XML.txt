There is no longer aBeautifulStoneSoupclass for parsing XML. To
parse XML you pass in "xml" as the second argument to theBeautifulSoupconstructor. For the same reason, theBeautifulSoupconstructor no longer recognizes theisHTMLargument.

Beautiful Soup's handling of empty-element XML tags has been
improved. Previously when you parsed XML you had to explicitly say
which tags were considered empty-element tags. TheselfClosingTagsargument to the constructor is no longer recognized. Instead,
Beautiful Soup considers any empty tag to be an empty-element tag. If
you add a child to an empty-element tag, it stops being an
empty-element tag.

Entities¶An incoming HTML or XML entity is always converted into the
corresponding Unicode character. Beautiful Soup 3 had a number of
overlapping ways of dealing with entities, which have been
removed. TheBeautifulSoupconstructor no longer recognizes thesmartQuotesToorconvertEntitiesarguments. (Unicode,
Dammitstill hassmart_quotes_to, but its default is now to turn
smart quotes into Unicode.) The constantsHTML_ENTITIES,XML_ENTITIES, andXHTML_ENTITIEShave been removed, since they
configure a feature (transforming some but not all entities into
Unicode characters) that no longer exists.If you want to turn Unicode characters back into HTML entities on
output, rather than turning them into UTF-8 characters, you need to
use anoutput formatter.
