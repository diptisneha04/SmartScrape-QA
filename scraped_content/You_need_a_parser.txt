Beautiful Soup 3 used Python'sSGMLParser, a module that was
deprecated and removed in Python 3.0. Beautiful Soup 4 useshtml.parserby default, but you can plug in lxml or html5lib and
use that instead. SeeInstalling a parserfor a comparison.

Installing a parser
Sincehtml.parseris not the same parser asSGMLParser, you
may find that Beautiful Soup 4 gives you a different parse tree than
Beautiful Soup 3 for the same markup. If you swap outhtml.parserfor lxml or html5lib, you may find that the parse tree changes yet
again. If this happens, you'll need to update your scraping code to
process the new tree.

Property names¶I renamed three attributes to avoid using words that have special
meaning to Python. Unlike my changes to method names (which you'll see
in the form of deprecation warnings), these changesdid not
preserve backwards compatibility.If you used these attributes in
BS3, your code will break in BS4 until you change them.UnicodeDammit.unicode->UnicodeDammit.unicode_markupTag.next->Tag.next_elementTag.previous->Tag.previous_element
