Beautiful Soup defines a fewNavigableStringsubclasses to
contain strings found inside specific HTML tags. This makes it easier
to pick out the main body of the page, by ignoring strings that
probably represent programming directives found within the
page.(These classes are new in Beautiful Soup 4.9.0, and the
html5lib parser doesn't use them.)
