List of Flutter Interview Questions For Fresher and Experienced Developers 1. What is Flutter? Flutter is an open-source, cross-platform application development framework that allows developers to create high-performance, beautiful, responsive applications for multiple platforms like Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, and the web using a single codebase. It is unique from other mobile app development frameworks for the following reasons: Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which is optimized for client-side development. Flutter provides a rich set of pre-built widgets that can be customized to create beautiful and responsive UI. Flutter uses a reactive programming model that allows for real-time updates and fast rendering of UI. Flutter has a hot reload feature that allows developers to see the changes in real time without having to rebuild the entire app. 2. What is Dart, and why is it used in Flutter? Dart is a client-side programming language that is used in Flutter for developing applications for multiple platforms like Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, and the web. Dart is used in Flutter because of the following reasons: Dart is optimized for client-side development, which makes it perfect for cross-platform application development with Flutter. Dart is a modern programming language that is easy to learn and use. Dart is a compiled language, which means that it is faster than interpreted languages like JavaScript. Dart has a sound-type system, which makes it easy to write and maintain large-scale applications. 3. What are the different types of widgets in Flutter? In Flutter, widgets are the building blocks for creating UI elements. There are two types of widgets in Flutter: Stateless widgets: These widgets are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once they are created. Stateless Widget are used when the UI elements do not need to be redrawn or updated frequently, such as a static text label or an icon. Stateless widgets are defined using the StatelessWidget class. Stateful widgets: These widgets are mutable and can be updated dynamically based on user interactions or other events. Stateful Widget are used when the UI elements need to be updated frequently, such as a list or form. Stateful widgets are defined using the StatefulWidget class. Note that stateful widgets require a State object to handle the mutable state, which is managed by the framework. 4. What is the difference between StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget in Flutter? In Flutter, StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget are two different types of widgets that are used to create UI elements. StatelessWidget StatefulWidget StatelessWidget is a widget that does not have any mutable state. StatefulWidget is a widget that has a mutable state. Once it is built, its properties cannot be changed. It can change its properties based on user interactions. Good to use, while showing static content in the app Good to use, while showing dynamic or interactive content in the app Examples of StatelessWidget include Text, Icons, and Images. Examples of StatefulWidget include TextField, Checkbox, and Slider. To know more refer this article: Difference Between Stateless and Stateful Widget in Flutter 5. What is the purpose of a key in Flutter? In Flutter, a Keyis an object that identifies a widget . It is used to maintain the state of the widget and to optimize the rendering performance of the app. When a widget is built, Flutter assigns a unique identity to it based on its location in the widget tree. However, when the widget tree is modified, such as when a widget is added, removed, or moved, the identity of the widgets can change. This can cause unexpected behavior and can lead to performance issues. To solve this problem, Flutter provides the Key class, which can be used to assign a unique identity to a widget that persists even if the widget tree is modified. Keys can be used to match widgets across different builds of the widget tree, ensuring that the state of the widget is preserved correctly. There are two main types of keys in Flutter: GlobalKey: This key is used to identify a widget from anywhere in the app. It is commonly used when a widget needs to be accessed or updated from multiple parts of the app, such as when managing the state of a form. LocalKey: This key is used to generate an unique key automatically and identify a widget based on a specific value, object identity. UniqueKey: This key is used generate unique key for every rebuild with the help of UniqueKey constructor. it ensures no two widgets having same key. ValueKey: This key is used to identify a widget based on specific value with the help of ValueKey constructor. It is commonly used when managing a list of items, such as in a ListView, where all items in the list are unique. ObjectKey: This key is used to identify a widget based on its object identity with the help of ObjectKey constructor. It is also used when managing a list of items, such as in a ListView, where the position of the item can change but its identity remains the same. 6. What is the difference between MaterialApp and WidgetsApp in Flutter? MaterialApp and WidgetsApp are two different types of applications in Flutter. MaterialApp WidgetsApp MaterialApp is used for creating applications that follow the Material Design guidelines. WidgetsApp is used for creating applications that do not follow the Material Design guidelines. It provides pre-built widgets that follow the Material Design specifications, such as AppBar, BottomNavigationBar, FloatingActionButton, Card and SnackBar . It provides a minimal set of widgets , such as Navigator, Text and GestureDetctor that can be used to create custom UI elements. Prefer, If you want to use inbuilt themes and design specification. Prefer, If you want to build custom theme and design specifications. 7. What are some common Flutter performance optimization techniques? Flutter provides many tools and techniques for optimizing the performance of your application. Here are some common ones: Minimizing widget rebuilds: Use the const and final keywords for widgets that don’t change, and use the shouldRebuild method to control when a widget should be rebuilt. Reducing the size of widgets: Use the SizedBoxwidget to create empty space and the Spacer widget to fill space. Use the Expanded widget to expand a child widget to fill available space. Using the right widgets: Use StatelessWidgets for widgets that don’t change, and StatefulWidgets for widgets that do change. Use the AnimatedBuilder widget to create animations, and use the FutureBuilder widget to handle asynchronous data. Reducing unnecessary layers: Use the ClipRRect widget to clip widgets to a specific shape, and use the RepaintBoundary widget to isolate expensive widgets from the rest of the widget tree. Minimizing expensive operations: Use the const keyword for variables that don’t change, and use the const constructor for objects that are created once and never change. Use lazy loading to defer expensive operations until they’re needed. Using the right data structures: Use the Set and Map data structures for efficient lookups and comparisons, and use the List data structure for ordered collections. Avoid using large assets: Try to use smallar size assets because using large assets take more time render. By following these techniques, you can optimize the performance of your Flutter application and provide a great user experience. 8. What is the difference between Navigator and Router in Flutter? Navigator and Router are two different ways of navigating between screens in a Flutter application. Navigator Router Navigator is a widget that is used to manage the navigation stack of an application Router is a more flexible and powerful way of managing the navigation stack It allows users to navigate back and forth between screens in the app using the back button or gestures It allows developers to customize the transition animations, handle complex navigation flows, and pass data between screens more easily Navigator provides a simple and easy-to-use way of managing the navigation stack, but it has some limitations when it comes to customizing the transition animations and handling complex navigation flows. Using a router requires more code and setup than using the built-in Navigator widget. Prefer, If you want to use inbuilt navigation system. Prefer, If you want to build custom navigation system. 9. What is State in Flutter? In Flutter, state refers to the data or information that can change dynamically during the lifetime of a widget. Widgets are the building blocks of a Flutter app, and they can be either stateful or stateless. Stateful widgets maintain state information and can update their state when required. The state is managed by a separate object known as a State object . The state object is created when astateful widget is inserted into the widget tree and is destroyed when the widget is removed from the tree . 10. What is the purpose of setState() in Flutter? setState() is a method that is used to update the state of a Stateful widget in Flutter. When a widget is updated, the Flutter framework calls the build() method of the widget to rebuild its UI based on the new state. – How setState() works : The setState() method is used to tell the Flutter framework that the state of the widget has changed and that it needs to rebuild the UI. The setState() method takes a function as an argument, which updates the state of the widget. Once the state is updated, the build() method is called again, and the UI is rebuilt. 11. What is the difference between StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget performance-wise? StatelessWidget is more performant than StatefulWidget because it does not have any mutable state. Once a StatelessWidget is built, its properties cannot be changed, and the Flutter framework does not need to track its state. StatefulWidget, on the other hand, is less performant than StatelessWidget because it has a mutable state. The Flutter framework needs to track the state of a StatefulWidget and rebuild its UI every time the state changes. However, the performance difference between StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget is usually negligible for most applications, and developers should choose the widget type based on their needs. 12. What is the purpose of the MaterialApp widget in Flutter? The MaterialApp widget is used to create a Material Design application in Flutter. It provides pre-built widgets that follow the Material Design specifications, such as AppBar, BottomNavigationBar, FloatingActionButton, Card and SnackBar. The MaterialApp widget also provides some important features, such as theme customization, internationalization support, and routing. It is the most commonly used widget for creating mobile applications in Flutter. To know more refer this article – MaterialApp class in Flutter . 13. What is the purpose of the Scaffold widget in Flutter? The Scaffold widget is used to create the basic UI structure of a Material Design application in Flutter. It provides a top app bar, a bottom navigation bar, and a body widget. The Scaffold widget also provides some important features, such as drawer support, floating action button support, and Snackbar support. It is the most commonly used widget for creating the basic structure of a Material Design application in Flutter. To know more refer this article – Scaffold class in Flutter with Examples . 14. What is the purpose of the BuildContext parameter in the build() method of a widget in Flutter? The BuildContext parameter is used to access the widget tree and perform actions such as building or updating widgets. The BuildContext object represents the location of a widget in the widget tree. It provides access to the nearest BuildContext ancestor, which can be used to access the properties of the ancestor widget or its children. The BuildContext parameter is required in the build() method of a widget because it is used to build the UI of the widget and its children. 15. What is the difference between push and pushReplacement methods in Flutter? In Flutter, push and pushReplacement are two methods that are used to navigate between different screens in an app. Both methods are available on the Navigator class, which manages the navigation stack in a Flutter app. The push method is used to push a new route onto the navigation stack, which adds a new screen to the app’s UI. This method does not remove the previous screen from the stack, which means that the user can use the back button or swipe gesture to navigate back to the previous screen. The pushReplacement method is similar to the push method, but it replaces the current screen on the navigation stack with a new screen. This means that the previous screen is removed from the stack and cannot be navigated back to using the back button or swipe gesture. So, the main difference between push and pushReplacement methods is that push adds a new screen to the navigation stack while pushReplacement replaces the current screen with a new screen. 16. What is the purpose of the Widget Inspector in Flutter? The Widget Inspector is a tool that is used to inspect and debug the widget tree of a Flutter application. The Widget Inspector provides information about the properties and state of each widget in the tree. It also allows developers to modify the properties and state of widgets in real-time, which can be useful for debugging UI issues. The Widget Inspector can be accessed by pressing the “Toggle Debug Paint” button in the Flutter DevTools, or by using the hotkey “ Ctrl + Alt + Shift + W ” in Android. 17. What is the purpose of the MediaQuery widget in Flutter? The MediaQuery widget is used to retrieve information about the device’s screen size and orientation in a Flutter application. The MediaQuery widget provides properties such as devicePixelRatio, orientation, and size which can be used to create responsive UIs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. For example, a developer could use the size property of the MediaQuery widget to adjust the font size of a text widget based on the screen size of the device. To know more refer this article – Flutter Managing the MediaQuery Object . 18. What is the purpose of the SafeArea widget in Flutter? The SafeArea widget is used to ensure that content is displayed within a safe area of the scree n that is not obscured by the device’s system UI, such as the status bar or navigation bar. The SafeArea widget is useful for creating UIs that need to be displayed on devices with different screen sizes or aspect ratios. It ensures that important content is not hidden by the device’s system UI, which can improve the user experience. To know more about topic refer to SafeArea in Flutter . 19. What is the purpose of the Expanded widget in Flutter? The Expanded widget is used to expand a child widget to fill the available space within a parent widget . The Expanded widget is commonly used in a Row or Column widget to evenly distribute space among its children. For example, if a Row widget has three child widgets, and one of the child widgets is wrapped in an Expanded widget, that child widget will expand to fill any remaining space in the row after the other two child widgets have been sized. To know more about topic refer to Flutter Expanded Widget . 20. What is the purpose of the Flex widget in Flutter? The Flex widget is used to create a flexible container that can be used to create complex layouts in a Flutter application. The Flex widget provides properties such as direction, mainAxisSize, and mainAxisAlignment, CrossAxisAlignment which can be used to control the layout of its children. For example, a developer could use the direction property of the Flex widget to create a horizontal or vertical layout and use the mainAxisAlignment property to align its children to the start, center, or end of the container. 21. What is the purpose of the ListView widget in Flutter? The ListView widget is used to display a scrolling list of items in a Flutter application. The ListView widget provides several different types of constructors, such as ListView.builder and ListView.separated, which can be used to customize the behavior of the list. For example, a developer could use the ListView.builder constructor to create a list of items from a list of data, or use the ListView.separated constructor to add separators between each item in the list. To know more about topic refer to ListView Class in Flutter . 22. What is the purpose of the GridView widget in Flutter? The GridView widget is used to display a grid of items in a Flutter application. The GridView widget provides several different types of constructors, such as GridView.builder and GridView.count, which can be used to customize the behavior of the grid. For example, a developer could use the GridView.builder constructor to create a grid of items from a list of data, or use the GridView.count constructor to specify the number of columns in the grid. To know more about topic refer to Flutter GridView 23. What is the difference between ListView and GridView in Flutter? While both widgets can be used to display similar types of data, there are some key differences between them. Properties ListView GridView Layout orientation It displays its items in a single column (either vertically or horizontally). It can display its items in a grid layout, with multiple columns and rows. Item layout Each item in the list is displayed below the previous item. Can also display horizontally. It displays its items in a grid layout, with each item placed in a cell in the grid. customizable using the GridView.count or GridView.builder constructors. Scrolling behavior It can be scrolled vertically or horizontally depending on the scrollDirection property and the scrolling behavior can be controlled. It also supports both vertical and horizontal scrolling, but it has additional scrolling behavior options, such as scrollable grids, and scrolling in both directions. Item placement It takes up the full width of the screen or its container, with a fixed height by default, unless specified otherwise. In GridView, the width and height of each item can be adjusted to fit the cell of the grid using the childAspectRatio property. Use cases Best for displaying lists like contacts, messages, or products. Ideal for grid layouts like image galleries, product grids, or categories. In summary, ListView and GridView are both useful widgets for displaying a list of items, but the choice of which to use depends on the layout and scrolling behavior of the items being displayed. ListView is best suited for displaying a list of items in a single column, while GridView is best suited for displaying items in a grid layout with multiple columns and rows. 24. What is a Stream in Flutter? A Stream is asequence of asynchronous events that can be listened to and responded to. Streams provide a way to handle asynchronous data flow, such as data from a network or user input. Streams in Flutter are based on the Dart Stream API, which provides a set of classes and methods for working with streams. The core concept of the Stream API is that it separates the producer of data from the consumer of data. The producer of data pushes data into the stream, while the consumer of data listens to the stream and responds to events as they are emitted. In Flutter, streams are commonly used to handle data from sources that emit events over time, such as user input, network responses, or device sensors. Streams are also used to handle animations and other dynamic UI elements that require continuous updates. To know more about topic refer to Dart Streams . 25. What is the purpose of the Wrap widget in Flutter? The Wrap widget is used to create a layout that wraps its children to the next line when there is not enough space to display them in a single line and it aligns the widgets in a horizontal and vertical manner. The Wrap widget is useful for creating UIs that need to display a large number of items that cannot fit on a single line. It ensures that the items are displayed in a way that maximizes the available space. The benefits of wrap widget compared to row or column include automatic wrapping, control of spacing, and flexible alignment. To know more refer this article – Flutter Wrap Widget . 26. What is the purpose of the Stack widget in Flutter? The Stack Widget is used to position widgets on top of each other in a Flutter application.

To know more refer this article – Flutter Inherited Widget . 35. What is the purpose of the ValueListenableBuilder widget in Flutter? The ValueListenableBuilder widget is used to rebuild a widget when the value of a ValueListenable object changes in a Flutter application. The ValueListenableBuilder widget provides a builder function that can be used to rebuild a widget tree when the value of a ValueListenable object changes. This idea is applied to bypass the problem with setState() , Problem: Whenever the value of a widget is updated through setState, it will rebuild the entire widget tree. Solution: Using valueNotifiers and ValueListenableBuilder we can rebuild only that specific widget rather than rebuilding whole widget tree. Therefore, Using valueNotifiers and ValueListenableBuilder instead of setState() improves the app’s performance. For example, a developer could use the ValueListenableBuilder widget to rebuild a widget that displays the current value of a counter object when the value of the counter object changes. To know more refer this article – Flutter Value Notifier . 36. What is the purpose of the StreamBuilder widget in Flutter? The StreamBuilder widget is used to listen to a stream of data and rebuild a widget when ever data is emitted by a Stream in a Flutter application. The StreamBuilder widget provides a builder function that can be used to rebuild a widget tree when data is emitted by a Stream.

To know more refer this article – Flutter FutureBuilder Widget . 47. What is the difference between StreamBuilder and FutureBuilder in Flutter? StreamBuilder and FutureBuilder are Flutter widgets created to deal with asynchronous operations but used for processing various types of data sources: StreamBuilder deals with real-time streams of data, and FutureBuilder processes single asynchronous computations. Below is an overview of how they differ from each other: Properties StreamBuilder FutureBuilder Purpose For continues updates. For one-time fetching. Handling data Listens to live data that changes over time single-time data loading. Interaction with UI whenever new data arrives, It will update the UI. Waits for the data to be ready, then updates the UI once Best for Best for real-time features like chat messages or stock prices. Best for API calls, database queries, or file reading. When to use when data keeps changing. when you fetch data once and don’t expect updates Example A news feed that updates automatically. Fetching user details from a server. To know more refer this articles: StreamBuilder Widget and FutureBuilder Widget . 48. Why do the Flutter apps take a long development time for the first time? When you create a Flutter app for the first time, it takes more time because: Dart Code: Your written code must be converted into something the phone will understand. Libraries: The app needs extra tools downloaded from Flutter. Flutter Engine: Everything required to operate the app is set up by Flutter. Assets: Images, fonts, and other files are included in the app. Hot Reload vs Hot Restart: A full build is time-consuming, but after that, Flutter can hot-reload the application very quickly. The initial build is slow because it’s initializing everything. Subsequent builds are fast because things are already initialized. 49. What are the different Widgets you can use to create a button without using button widgets? In Flutter, there are several types of widgets that you can use to create a button-like behavior without using the built-in button widgets. Here are a few examples: GestureDetector : The GestureDetector widget can detect a wide range of gestures, such as taps, swipes, and long presses. You can use this widget to detect a tap gesture and execute a function in response, effectively creating a button-like behavior. Here’s an example: Dart GestureDetector ( onTap: () { // Do something when the widget is tapped }, child: Container ( width: 100 , height: 50 , color: Colors . blue , child: Center ( child: Text ( 'Button' ), ), ), ) To know more refer this article: GestureDetector Widget . InkWell : The InkWell widget provides a material design-style ink splash effect when the widget is pressed. You can use this widget to create a button-like behavior with a visual feedback effect. Here’s an example: Dart InkWell ( onTap: () { // Do something when the widget is tapped }, child: Container ( width: 100 , height: 50 , color: Colors . blue , child: Center ( child: Text ( 'Button' ), ), ), ) To know more refer this article: InkWell Widget . 50.  Which one is better Flutter or React Native? The choice between Flutter and React Native largely depends on your specific needs and requirements.
