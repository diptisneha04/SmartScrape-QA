Our DAA Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both.
Our DAA Tutorial includes all topics of algorithm, asymptotic analysis, algorithm control structure, recurrence, master method, recursion tree method, simple sorting algorithm, bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, divide and conquer, binary search, merge sort, counting sort, lower bound theory etc.
What is Algorithm?
A finite set of instruction that specifies a sequence of operation is to be carried out in order to solve a specific problem or class of problems is called an Algorithm.
Why study Algorithm?
As the speed of processor increases, performance is frequently said to be less central than other software quality characteristics (e.g. security, extensibility, reusability etc.). However, large problem sizes are commonplace in the area of computational science, which makes performance a very important factor. This is because longer computation time, to name a few mean slower results, less through research and higher cost of computation (if buying CPU Hours from an external party). The study of Algorithm, therefore, gives us a language to express performance as a function of problem size.

MCQ Exercise on Design and Analysis of Algorithms
Question 1:
Which of the following best defines an algorithm?
A large set of random instructions.
A finite set of instructions that specifies a sequence of operations to solve a specific problem or class of problems.
A set of programs written in a high-level programming language.
An infinite loop of instructions.
Show Answer
Workspace
Answer:
B. A finite set of instructions that specifies a sequence of operations to solve a specific problem or class of problems.
Explanation:
An algorithm is a step-by-step method or formula to solve a problem. It should have a clear end point, which means it's limited, and it should provide an answer for a specific problem or group of problems.
Question 2:
Which notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time?
Θ (Theta)
Ω (Omega)
O (Big O)
o (Small o)
Show Answer
Workspace
Answer:
C. O (Big O)
Explanation:
Big O notation describes the upper limit of an algorithm's running time. It sets a maximum limit on the time complexity showing the worst-case scenario as the data size grows.
Question 3:
Which sorting algorithm has the best average-case time complexity?
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Show Answer
Workspace
Answer:
D. Merge Sort
Explanation:
Merge Sort has an average case time complexity of O(n log n). This makes it better than Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort, which all have O(n^2) typical case time complexities.
Question 4:
In the Divide and Conquer method, which of the following algorithms helps find a specific value within a sorted array?
Bubble Sort
Binary Search
Quick Sort
Insertion Sort
Show Answer
Workspace
Answer:
B. Binary Search
Explanation:
Binary Search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that finds a specific value in a sorted array. It splits the array in half until it finds the target value or runs out of search space.
Question 5:
Which problem-solving approach is particularly useful for optimization problems where the problem can be broken down into overlapping subproblems?
Greedy Algorithm
Divide and Conquer
Dynamic Programming
Backtracking
Show Answer
Workspace
Answer:
C. Dynamic Programming
Explanation:
Dynamic Programming helps solve optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems that overlap. This method saves the results of subproblems to avoid doing the same calculations over and over. This makes it work well for problems like figuring out Fibonacci numbers, multiplying matrices, and solving the 0/1 knapsack problem.
