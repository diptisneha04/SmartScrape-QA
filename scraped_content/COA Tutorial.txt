1 min read
Computer Organization and Architecture Tutorial provides in-depth knowledge of internal working, structuring, and implementation of a computer system.
Whereas, Organization defines the way the system is structured so that all those catalogued tools can be used properly.
Our Computer Organization and Architecture Tutorial includes all topics of such as introduction, ER model, keys, relational model, join operation, SQL, functional dependency, transaction, concurrency control, etc.
What is Computer Architecture and Organization?
In general terms, the architecture of a computer system can be considered as a catalogue of tools or attributes that are visible to the user such as instruction sets, number of bits used for data, addressing techniques, etc.
Whereas, Organization of a computer system defines the way system is structured so that all those catalogued tools can be used. The significant components of Computer organization are ALU, CPU, memory and memory organization.
Prerequisite
Before learning the concepts of Computer Architecture and Organization, you should have a basic knowledge prior to Computer Architecture, basic functional units of a computer system, etc.
Audience
Our COA tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals.
Problem
We can assure you that you will not find any problem in this tutorial. However, if you find any, you can post the questions in the contact form.
