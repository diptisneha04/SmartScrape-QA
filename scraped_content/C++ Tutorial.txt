C++ Tutorial

4 min read
C++ tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of C++. Our C++ tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.
C++ is an object-oriented programming language. It is an extension to
C programming
.
Our C++ tutorial includes all topics of C++ such as first example, control statements, objects and classes,
inheritance
,
constructor
, destructor, this, static, polymorphism, abstraction, abstract class, interface, namespace, encapsulation, arrays, strings, exception handling, File IO, etc.
What is C++
C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.
C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.
C++ Program
In this tutorial, all C++ programs are given with C++ compiler so that you can easily change the C++ program code.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
Compile and Run C++ Program
Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
C++ supports the object-oriented programming, the four major pillar of object-oriented programming (
OOPs
) used in C++ are:
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Abstraction
C++ Standard Libraries
Standard C++ programming is divided into three important parts:
The core library includes the data types, variables and literals, etc.
The standard library includes the set of functions manipulating strings, files, etc.
The Standard Template Library (STL) includes the set of methods manipulating a data structure.
Usage of C++
By the help of C++ programming language, we can develop different types of secured and robust applications:
Window application
Client-Server application
Device drivers
Embedded firmware etc
