Top 50 Penetration Testing Interview Questions and Answers Last Updated : 05 Nov, 2024 Comments Improve Suggest changes Like Article Like Report Penetration testing stands for a process where the security of a computer system is tested by trying to gain access to its internal systems. In order to carry out penetration testing, an attacker must first identify which ports are open on the target machine and then use those ports in order to exploit security vulnerabilities. Once these vulnerabilities are exploited, the attacker can break into the target computer and try different passwords or commands in an attempt to find sensitive information that may be stored there. Here, we have covered the top 50 Penetration Testing interview questions with their answers . List of Top 50 Penetration Testing Interview Questions 1. What is XPath Injection in penetration testing? XPath injection is a type of vulnerability in which malicious input is used to inject unintended commands into an XML document. This can be done by injecting any user-supplied string directly into an XPath expression, or even by using specially crafted elements and attributes. Injection attacks are one of the most common methods used to exploit software vulnerabilities because they allow attackers to run arbitrary code as part of the attack payload. 2. Explain Web Application Scanning with w3af in pen-testing? w3af is versatile and can be used for a number of purposes in pen-testing. For example, it can be used to identify vulnerabilities in web applications before conducting a full attack, to check for signs of malware and phishing attacks, and to monitor for security issues. In addition, w3af can be used to identify vulnerabilities in outdated or insecure web applications. 3. Explain reflected XSS Vulnerability. Reflected XSS vulnerability occurs when data entered in a web form is accessed by an unpatched web browser and interpreted by the application. The data entered in the form is then displayed on the web page as if it was coming from the user’s web browser. This vulnerability is exploited when an attacker sends a specially crafted input to a web form that is then reflected in the web page. This allows the attacker to inject malicious code into the web page and to run the code without being detected. For more details, you can refer to the following article – What is Cross-site Scripting? 4. What is Hijacking Execution in pen-testing? Hijacking execution in penetration testing is a technique that attackers use to gain access to systems or networks. Hijacking execution takes advantage of the privileges and permissions granted to an intruder by default on compromised machines, which can then be used for malicious purposes. Attackers may also leverage user accounts created specifically for reconnaissance or attack tasks, as well as preexisting administrative rights on target machines. By taking advantage of these vulnerabilities, hijackers can bypass common security controls and compromise systems without being detected. 5. Write a few points about SEH Overwrite Exploits? SEH Overwrite Exploits are a type of security exploit that allows an attacker to execute code on a target system in memory, even if the target process has normal read, write, and execute permissions. These exploits take advantage of security vulnerabilities in the operating system or application. They can be used to run malicious code on a targeted system, steal data, or implant malware. A lot of remote code execution (RCE) exploits are available for the Server Executable Hypervisor, or SEH. 6. What is POP POP RET in penetration testing? POP POP RET is a tool that can be used to detect and exploit vulnerable applications. To use this tool, you will first need to scan the target network for vulnerable applications.

In penetration testing, token impersonation is a technique that is used to gain access to resources or systems that are protected by authentication methods such as passwords or tokens. Token impersonation is used to access these resources by pretending to be someone other than the user who is supposed to be accessing them. Token Impersonation can also be used as part of social engineering attacks or phishing exercises. 13. What is Pass the Hash in penetration testing? Pass the Hash is a popular cyber security testing practice used to find vulnerable systems and test whether they can be exploited by attackers. It works like an attacker tries different passwords on a target system in order to see if any of them are valid – or, more accurately, triggers the authentication process required for access to that system. By doing this, the tester can then gain access to the account without having to actually break into the system. 14. What is SSHExec? SSHExec is a remote shell interface implemented in the SSH protocol. It allows an attacker to run commands on the target machine over SSH without having to be physically present on that system. SSHExec works by establishing a connection between the attacker’s system and the target system. Once the connection is established, the attacker can run commands or scripts on the target system. 15. What are Socks4a and Proxy Chains? A socks4a and proxy chains are two types of network analysis tools that are used for penetration testing. socks4a works as a proxy and can intercept packets leaving and entering your targeted systems. It can be used to map the flows of traffic and can be used to examine protocols and handshake data. On the other hand, proxy chains can be used to combine socks4a with various command-line tools to perform various actions on the proxy such as injecting packets, capturing packets, and mangling packets. 16. What is Local File Inclusion (LFI)? Local file inclusion (LFI) is a technique used by attackers to include malicious files in the request packets sent to vulnerable systems. This can allow an attacker to access privileged information, or even execute arbitrary code on the target system. LFI vulnerabilities are particularly prevalent in web applications and can be exploited remotely by attacking users who visit affected websites. By including specially crafted requests within HTTP requests, an attacker can inject scripts into pages served up by the application, giving them full control over those pages and any data stored within them. 17. What is Remote File Inclusion (RFI)? Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is an exploit technique used in penetration testing whereby a malicious user includes files on the target server that are not actually part of the web application or system being tested. These files can be stored anywhere, but they must exist outside of the document root. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary script code into pages served up by vulnerable servers – potentially allowing them to steal data, execute commands as privileged users or even take over entirely compromised systems. 18. Explain Leveraging XSS with the Browser Exploitation Framework? Exploiting XSS in web applications is a common technique used by hackers. XSS, or Cross-Site Scripting, is an attack where a malicious user injects scripts into a website to inject malicious code into the user’s browser. These scripts can inject any script or HTML into a document, which when viewed by a user, can execute without their consent or knowledge. Browser Exploitation Framework (BFX) is a tool used by hackers to exploit XSS in web applications. 19. What is War-FTP? War-FTP is a program used in penetration testing which allows users to FTP through an insecure network. FTP is an application used to transfer files between computers.

In some cases, these weaknesses may also lead to fraudulent activities such as identity theft or credit card fraud. 32. What is Software and Data Integrity Failures vulnerability? Software and data integrity failures vulnerability (SDF) is a type of security vulnerability that can occur when software or data are not properly protected from unauthorized access. SDFs arise when an attacker gains access to sensitive information, such as passwords or user account details, by exploiting one of the vulnerabilities in the system. When these confidential records are compromised, it could lead to serious consequences for the users involved. A breach involving personal data can have devastating effects on individuals’ careers and social lives. 33. What is Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability? Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability in web applications that allows an attacker to inject illegitimate requests into the application, resulting in unauthorized access or modification of data. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking the user into submitting a specially crafted request to the server. SSRF attacks are typically used as part of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and can be very successful if executed against privileged accounts with admin rights on target websites. For more details, please refer to the article – Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Depth . 34. What is Frame Injection vulnerability? Frame injection vulnerability is a type of security flaw that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary frames into the flow of traffic passing through a website or application. This can be accomplished by injecting frames into the response sent from the server to the browser, or by manipulating elements in an HTTP request header. Frames are small pieces of HTML or XML that make up document content and are displayed within a web page as if they were part of the document itself. By inserting malicious frames into these responses, attackers may be able to inject code directly onto websites and applications users’ screens-causing them serious personal loss of injury, data theft, and even loss of revenue for businesses online. 35. What is URL Redirection vulnerability? URL Redirection vulnerability is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to redirect the user’s browser to a different website than was intended. This attack can be performed by tricking the victim into clicking on a malicious link or opening an illegitimate file. Redirections may also occur when users attempt to access pages that have been moved from their original location, due not only to human error but also to intentional manipulation by hackers and/or cybercriminals. URL redirection vulnerabilities are often used in malware attacks because they allow attackers to install infected files on targeted machines without the user ever knowing about it. You can also refer to the article Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards . 36. What is penetration testing dropbox? Penetration testing dropbox is a security tool that can be used by security professionals to collect logs, artifacts, and other information from targets.

This data can be used to conduct further penetration tests on the target machines. 37. Explain How Data is Protected During and after Penetration Testing? Security professionals refer to data protection as its own discipline unto itself – protecting confidential personal information, sensitive company files, and secure network communications. Protecting data involves ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility. Confidentiality ensures that data is kept secret from unauthorized parties who might try to steal or otherwise misappropriate the information, either personally or via the organization. Information security specialists have traditionally protected systems using access controls, firewalls, passwords, encryption/decryption techniques, intrusion detection software, etc. 38. Explain How Risk Analysis and Penetration Testing Are Different from Each Other? Risk Analysis and Penetration Testing are both important aspects of information security, however, they have some key differences. Risk Analysis is the process of identifying, quantifying, and assessing the potential risks associated with a security vulnerability, system, or process. Penetration Testing is the process of testing a system’s vulnerability to attack by trying to exploit discovered vulnerabilities. Penetration Testing can be used to find vulnerabilities that could be harmful if exploited. 39. Does Penetration Testing Break a System? In a penetration testing scenario, an exploit may be used to gain access to a system or to elevate privileges on the system. This may then be used to explore the target system in order to identify other vulnerabilities. Once vulnerabilities have been identified, penetration testers often use them to exploit systems to further assess the level of risk involved. 40. Is Penetration Testing Important If the Company Has a Firewall? A firewall is a device that helps protect computer systems from unauthorized access. It does this by blocking or preventing traffic from entering and leaving the system. In most cases, firewalls are installed on servers, networks, and individual workstations in order to protect these devices against attacks by outside malicious parties such as hackers or cyberspies. 41. Why Should Penetration Testing Be Carried out by a Third Party? When it comes to security, many organizations have a tendency of neglecting the perimeter. While this is understandable in the vast majority of cases, due to breaches that often originate from outside sources such as phishing and malware attacks, failing to properly secure your internal network can be shut down. A third-party penetration testing firm can help alleviate some of these problems by providing reliable and accurate information about vulnerabilities present in your organization’s systems or networks. Additionally, they can provide guidance on how best to address them – whether through vulnerability assessment or remediation. 42. What Are the Legal Steps Involved in Penetration Testing? There are many different types of tests that a penetration tester might do. These include: Vulnerability scanning is the practice of scanning systems for potentially exploitable vulnerabilities. IQ scanning is the use of intrusive and often automated methods to determine the security of systems. Social engineering is the practice of exploiting human factors to gain access to systems. Physical access is the attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems through direct or remote access. 43. Can Penetration Testing Be Automated? One of the key challenges in Penetration Testing is automated scanning and gathering of data. And this is where automation comes into the picture. Automation allows a penetration tester to automate the tasks that help in data gathering. This way, data is captured and analyzed in a systematic and efficient manner.
