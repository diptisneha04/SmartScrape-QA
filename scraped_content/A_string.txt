¶
The simplest filter is a string. Pass a string to a search method and
Beautiful Soup will perform a tag-name match against that exact string.
This code finds all the <b> tags in the document:
soup.find_all('b')# [<b>The Dormouse's story</b>]
soup.find_all('b')# [<b>The Dormouse's story</b>]
soup.find_all('b')# [<b>The Dormouse's story</b>]

soup
.
find_all
(
'b'
)
# [<b>The Dormouse's story</b>]
If you pass in a byte string, Beautiful Soup will assume the string is
encoded as UTF-8. You can avoid this by passing in a Unicode string instead.
A regular expression¶If you pass in a regular expression object, Beautiful Soup will filter
against that regular expression using itssearch()method. This code
finds all the tags whose names start with the letter "b"; in this
case, the <body> tag and the <b> tag:importrefortaginsoup.find_all(re.compile("^b")):print(tag.name)# body# bThis code finds all the tags whose names contain the letter 't':fortaginsoup.find_all(re.compile("t")):print(tag.name)# html# title
