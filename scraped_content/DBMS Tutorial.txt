DBMS Tutorial - Learn Database Management System
27 Mar 2025

5 min read
DBMS Tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of
Database
. Our DBMS Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both.
Database management system is software that is used to manage the database.
Our
DBMS
Tutorial includes all topics of DBMS such as introduction, ER model, keys, relational model, join operation,
SQL
, functional dependency, transaction, concurrency control, etc.
What is Database
The database is a collection of inter-related data which is used to retrieve, insert and delete the data efficiently. It is also used to organize the data in the form of a table, schema, views, and reports, etc.
For example:
The college Database organizes the data about the admin, staff, students and faculty etc.
Using the database, you can easily retrieve, insert, and delete the information.
Database Management System
Database management system is a software which is used to manage the database. For example:
MySQL
,
Oracle
, etc are a very popular commercial database which is used in different applications.
DBMS provides an interface to perform various operations like database creation, storing data in it, updating data, creating a table in the database and a lot more.
It provides protection and security to the database. In the case of multiple users, it also maintains data consistency.
DBMS allows users the following tasks:
Data Definition:
It is used for creation, modification, and removal of definition that defines the organization of data in the database.
Data Updation:
It is used for the insertion, modification, and deletion of the actual data in the database.
Data Retrieval:
It is used to retrieve the data from the database which can be used by applications for various purposes.
User Administration:
It is used for registering and monitoring users, maintain data integrity, enforcing data security, dealing with concurrency control, monitoring performance and recovering information corrupted by unexpected failure.
Characteristics of DBMS
It uses a digital repository established on a server to store and manage the information.
It can provide a clear and logical view of the process that manipulates data.
DBMS contains automatic backup and recovery procedures.
It contains ACID properties which maintain data in a healthy state in case of failure.
It can reduce the complex relationship between data.
It is used to support manipulation and processing of data.
It is used to provide security of data.
It can view the database from different viewpoints according to the requirements of the user.
Advantages of DBMS
Controls database redundancy:
It can control data redundancy because it stores all the data in one single database file and that recorded data is placed in the database.
Data sharing:
In DBMS, the authorized users of an organization can share the data among multiple users.
Easily Maintenance:
It can be easily maintainable due to the centralized nature of the database system.
Reduce time:
It reduces development time and maintenance need.
Backup:
It provides backup and recovery subsystems which create automatic backup of data from
hardware
and
software
failures and restores the data if required.
multiple user interface:
It provides different types of user interfaces like graphical user interfaces, application program interfaces
Disadvantages of DBMS
Cost of Hardware and Software:
It requires a high speed of data processor and large memory size to run DBMS software.
Size:
It occupies a large space of disks and large memory to run them efficiently.
Complexity:
Database system creates additional complexity and requirements.
Higher impact of failure:
Failure is highly impacted the database because in most of the organization, all the data stored in a single database and if the database is damaged due to electric failure or database corruption then the data may be lost forever.
Prerequisite
Before learning DBMS Tutorial, you must have the basic knowledge of Basic Database.
Audience
Our DBMS Tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals.
Problem
We assure that you will not find any problem with this DBMS Tutorial. But if there is any mistake, please post the problem in the contact form.
DBMS MCQs
1. Which of the following is a characteristic of a distributed database system?
Data is stored in a centralized location
Data can be accessed and processed from multiple locations
There is no need for a network to connect databases
It does not support transaction management
Show Answer
Workspace
Answer: B
Explanation:
A distributed database system is characterized by having its data spread across different locations, which can be accessed and processed from these various locations. This setup typically requires a network for communication between the distributed sites and supports transaction management to ensure data consistency and integrity across the system.
2. In SQL, what does the command GRANT SELECT ON students TO user123; do?
It revokes the SELECT permission on the 'students' table from 'user123'.
It grants the INSERT permission on the 'students' table to 'user123'.
It grants the SELECT permission on the 'students' table to 'user123'.
It revokes all permissions on the 'students' table from 'user123'.
Show Answer
Workspace
Answer: C
Explanation:
The GRANT statement in SQL is used to provide specific permissions to users. In this case, GRANT SELECT ON students TO user123; gives the user 'user123' permission to perform SELECT operations on the 'students' table.
3. Which of the following scenarios is an example of a non-repeatable read?
A transaction reads the same row twice, and the row is updated by another transaction in between reads.
A transaction reads the same row twice, and the row is deleted by another transaction in between reads.
A transaction reads all rows that satisfy a condition, and another transaction inserts a new row that satisfies the condition before the first transaction completes.
A transaction reads a row, and another transaction inserts a new row before the first transaction completes.
Show Answer
Workspace
Answer: A
Explanation:
A non-repeatable read occurs when a transaction reads the same row twice and finds different values each time due to an update by another transaction. It is one of the phenomena prevented by the isolation level known as repeatable read.
4. In an E-R diagram, which of the following symbols is used to represent a weak entity set?
Rectangle
Ellipse
Double rectangle
Diamond
Show Answer
Workspace
Answer: C
Explanation:
In an Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagram, a weak entity set is represented by a double rectangle. Weak entities are those that do not have a primary key and rely on a strong entity (with a primary key) for their existence. The relationship between the weak and strong entities is represented with a double diamond.
5. Which of the following statements about B-trees is FALSE?
B-trees are balanced tree data structures.
All leaf nodes of a B-tree are at the same level.
B-trees provide efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.
B-trees do not maintain sorted order of elements.
Show Answer
Workspace
Answer: D
Explanation:
B-trees are balanced tree data structures that maintain their elements in sorted order. They provide efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations, and all leaf nodes are at the same level, ensuring balanced access times. Therefore, the statement that B-trees do not maintain sorted order is false.
