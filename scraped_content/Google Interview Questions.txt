Google Interview Questions Last Updated : 15 Oct, 2024 Comments Improve Suggest changes Like Article Like Report As per, the Google Career Page there are two types of interviews, Phone/Hangout interviews, and Onsite Interviews. Below is an excerpt for their official page. For software engineering candidates, we want to understand your coding skills and technical areas of expertise, including tools or programming languages and general knowledge on topics like data structures and algorithms. There’s generally some back and forth in these discussions, just like there is on the job, because we like to push each other’s thinking and learn about different approaches. So be prepared to talk through your solutions in depth. Push your own boundaries and find the best answer—that’s probably how you work anyway.
