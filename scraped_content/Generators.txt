XML¶There is no longer aBeautifulStoneSoupclass for parsing XML. To
parse XML you pass in "xml" as the second argument to theBeautifulSoupconstructor. For the same reason, theBeautifulSoupconstructor no longer recognizes theisHTMLargument.Beautiful Soup's handling of empty-element XML tags has been
improved. Previously when you parsed XML you had to explicitly say
which tags were considered empty-element tags. TheselfClosingTagsargument to the constructor is no longer recognized. Instead,
Beautiful Soup considers any empty tag to be an empty-element tag. If
you add a child to an empty-element tag, it stops being an
empty-element tag.
